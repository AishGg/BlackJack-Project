Game Rules

    The player and dealer are both dealt two cards to start the game.
    The player can choose to "Hit" (receive another card) or "Stand" (keep the current hand).
    The dealer must continue drawing cards ("Hit") until their hand value reaches 17 or higher.

    Choose to "Hit" to receive another card or "Stand" to hold your hand.
    The game will automatically compare your hand against the dealer's and declare the winner!
